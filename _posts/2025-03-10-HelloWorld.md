Hey there! 
<br/>
My aim is to help you write Hello World in D365 F&O.
<br/>
<br/>
```
Info("Hello world!");
```
<br/>
```
Warning("Hello world!");
```
<br/>
<br/>
As seen above, we wrote it in two different ways. One is warning and one is info. Their only difference is hello world inside info brackets will appear as an informational banner while the hello world inside the warning brackets will appear as a warning banner.
<br/>
